# myFirstTsx

Introduction to tsx.

## Getting Started (on windows)

- run `npm i typescript --g` th e--g flag saves the dependancy globally. After intallation , you can confirm the version by ` tsc --v`

### tsc command not found (Error, troubleshoot)

What worked for me :

- changing the path to ` C:\Users\<your user name>\AppData\Roaming\npm> npm i typescript --g. run ``` tsc --v ``` to be sure `
